1. 4 elements
2. Namespace is the manifest at the top.
3. parent: application
children: activity, intent-filter, service
intent filter is parent to action and category
service is child of application
4. I think these are the empty ones even though they have attributes?
 <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
<category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
<activity android:name=".InformationActivity" />
